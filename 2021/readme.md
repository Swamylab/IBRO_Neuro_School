## Summary
The 2020 IBRO school was held online due to the global pandemic. 

The goal of this year's lab was to expose students to python programming and markerless behavioral analysis in [DeepLabcut (DLC)](http://www.mackenziemathislab.org/deeplabcut). We took in 14 students, broke them into three groups and assigned each an analysis machine on which they could learn how to run DLC and then work through a python notebook which would take DLC tracking variables and perform subsequent analysis. 

The class analyzed videos based on an elegant visual-behavioral test in which mice are trained to hunt small insects (crickets).
